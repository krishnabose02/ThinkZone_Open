        <span style='color: #2196f3;font-size: 1.6rem'>ThinkZone</span> is an award winning social impact startup that enables women entrepreneurs to drive technology-based learning in low-income communities. ThinkZone implements a comprehensive, scale-driven lean model through its ‘school-in-a-box’ solution to deliver quality early childhood and primary-level education programs at less than a dollar a month per child.
    </p>
    <p>
        ThinkZone uses offline technology, proprietary teaching activities and class management tools while following the Teaching-at-the-Right-Level approach(an MIT evidence-based pedagogy) to improve learning levels of children. Through providing low-income women with training and income-generating opportunities, ThinkZone also contributes to greater gender equality.
    </p>
    <p>    
        This is probably the very few times in India where a technology-based pedagogy is built for first generation learners and for teachers who come from limited education background.
