**ThinkZone TeacherApp** 

I built and changed a considerable part of this application as a part of my 2 month internship. But they made me work for around 4 months in total and paid for one month.

I feel disgusted. They are a education providing startup, and I really wonder what quality of education they would bring upon the table with such a distracted sense of morality. If you can't treat your employees right, what values do you impart as a education provider?

If you're seeing this repo for some reason or the other, if you're a student looking for an internship, be aware. There is a whole scamming industry brewing in the country in the name of internships. You're worth more than you think. You're worth more than they think. Learn to value yourself.

All the best.
